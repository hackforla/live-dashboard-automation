CodeQL raised alerts regarding the script `babel.js` which is loaded from the cloudflare CDN.   A code fix was recommended but before implementing we need to ensure that the babel.js script is still required and should still be served from a CDN.  . Even if Babel is required, there may be a more efficient means of applying it, prior to the browser.

### Details
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. With most modern browsers have already implemented nearly all features of es6, the requirement for Babel is reduced greatly, but Babel does perform other functions including transforming syntax, Code mods and polyfills.  

CodeQL alerts:
https://github.com/hackforla/website/security/code-scanning/36
https://github.com/hackforla/website/security/code-scanning/37

The alerts were raised in  `_layouts/default-markdown.html` and `_layouts/default.html`.  It is not clear if `_layouts/default-markdown.html` is in current use. 

### Issue you discovered this emergent requirement in
- #5297

### Date discovered 


### Did you have to do something temporarily
- [ ] YES
- [x] NO

### Who was involved
@freaky4wrld @roslynwythe 

### What happens if this is not addressed
The security concern is that if an attacker were to gain control of the CDN, a corrupted script could be loaded into any Hack for LA webpage

- https://medium.com/@codingstorytime/set-up-a-build-environment-using-babel-and-webpack-172110681b1

### Recommended Action Items
- [ ] Determine if Babel.js is still required
   - [ ] If babel is still required, does it have to be served from a CDN?  Could it be applied at build time?
   - [ ] Is the file `_layouts/default-markdown.html` still in use?  If not, create an issue to remove it, and dismiss alert 36
- [ ] If we still need to load babel.js from a CDN, make a new issue(s) for updating the code as required to resolve each alert and perform testing to ensure that the solution is effective
- [ ] Let a Team Lead know

### Potential solutions [draft]
#### Code change
add the attributes:
```
integrity=""generated-sri-hash"" crossorigin=""anonymous""
```
to the relevant script tags
#### Testing:
- the most simple would be using the `console` and look for any issues with the script or its integrity
- another one could be using the `network tab and look for the external scripts failure
- maybe using a `fallback mechanism` with `<noscript> tag` indicating a failure in the script loading
- Or the best would be `deliberately tampering the babel script or introduce an error in the script URL to simulate a tampered or failed script` and observing its behaviour.

- [ ] Read sections 3.1.a - 3.1.c in [3.1 How to make a pull request](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/2e3c45fede99e61f479548ccca3f0dda83e351db/CONTRIBUTING.md#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to learn more about how to make a pull request (PR) for the issue that you are working on and how to make changes to your PR if changes are requested by the reviewer
- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (two per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label ""Status: Help Wanted"" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the ""Development team meeting discussion items"" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.

2. Usually we don't want to you have more than one issue assigned to you at a time, this issue is the exception, because it is instructions on how to work on other issues.
3. The action items listed below should mostly be worked on in a sequential order. However, you don't have to wait on one if you can proceed with the others, For instance, you don't have to wait for attending a weekly meeting before setting up your dev environment.

    ```
   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**.

- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (two per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label ""Status: Help Wanted"" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the ""Development team meeting discussion items"" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.

We need to understand the purpose and status of the Daniel Ridge bot and its repo  'check-ghpages-versions', to determine if the Website team should take responsibility for maintaining it.


### Details
Daniel Ridge Bot repo  'check-ghpages-versions' is intended to automatically check the dependencies for the Docker image created from [ghpages-docker](https://github.com/hackforla/ghpages-docker), and when necessary, to update the ghphages-docker Dockerfile, build a new image and push it to Docker Hub.  

### Action Items
- [ ] Read <a href=""https://github.com/hackforla/ops/wiki/%40danielridgebot-Ops-Wiki#danielridgebot"" target=""_blank"">DanielRidge Bot Wiki</a>
- [ ] Determine if the workflows are still needed, and if so, check the status and effectiveness of the workflows and whether any maintenance is required.  
- [ ] The possibility of a stale Dockerfile has been raised in connection with several issues including #5644 and #5647.  Determine if the Daniel Ridge bot could play a role in solutions to these issues.
- [ ] Record findings in a comment in this issue
- [ ] Move this issue to ""Questions/In Review"" and add the label ""ready for dev lead""

  - [ ] If an issue branch is created while a previous issue branch is checked out, the new issue branch will contain extraneous commits
  - [ ] If some file changes were not committed in a branch, those changes can persist and will be included in a commit if a developer runs `git add --all` or `git add .`.  
- [ ] Describe the use of `git reset` to remove commits
- [ ] Describe the need to use `git push --force` to push commits after `git reset`

1. Be a member of Hack for LA. (There are no fees to join.) If you have not joined yet, please follow the steps on our [Getting Started page](https://www.hackforla.org/getting-started).
2. Before you claim or start working on an issue, please make sure you have read our [How to Contribute to Hack for LA Guide](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/7f0c132c96f71230b8935759e1f8711ccb340c0f/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Overview
We need to create a single variable `github-handle` to hold the github handle for each member of the leadership team.  Eventually `github-handle` will replace the `github` and `picture` variables, reducing redundancy in the project file.  

### Action Items
- [ ] Open the file `_projects/access-the-data.md` in the IDE
- [ ] Replace:
```
  - name: Aparna Gopal
```
with
```
  - name: Aparna Gopal
    github-handle: 
```
- [ ] Do not use a tab to indent `github-handle`. YAML doesn't allow tabs; it requires spaces.
- [ ] Using docker, confirm that the appearance of the project webpage is unchanged at all screen sizes.  The project webpage URL can be found below under Resources.   

### For Merge Team
- [ ] Release the dependency for this issue in #5441.  If all the dependencies have been completed, close that issue.

2. Before you claim or start working on an issue, please make sure you have read our [How to Contribute to Hack for LA Guide](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/7f0c132c96f71230b8935759e1f8711ccb340c0f/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Overview
We need to create a single variable `github-handle` to hold the github handle for each member of the leadership team.  Eventually `github-handle` will replace the `github` and `picture` variables, reducing redundancy in the project file.  

### Action Items
- [ ] Open the file `_projects/access-the-data.md` in the IDE
- [ ] Replace:
```
  - name: Jason Yung
```
with
```
  - name: Jason Yung
    github-handle: 
```
- [ ] Do not use a tab to indent `github-handle`. YAML doesn't allow tabs; it requires spaces.
- [ ] Using docker, confirm that the appearance of the project webpage is unchanged at all screen sizes.  The project webpage URL can be found below under Resources.   

### For Merge Team
- [ ] Release the dependency for this issue in #5441.  If all the dependencies have been completed, close that issue.

   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (two per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [x] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label ""Status: Help Wanted"" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the ""Development team meeting discussion items"" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.

2. Usually we don't want to you have more than one issue assigned to you at a time, this issue is the exception, because it is instructions on how to work on other issues.

- [ ] Once you take a good first issue, you will provide estimates and progress reports. Also, once you finish providing your ""Estimate"" action item below, please answer the question in the ""Time spent so far"" action item (also below).
   - [ ] Estimate: Copy the below and put it in the ""good first issue"" that you picked.
 Check this box when you have completed this task so that we can identify if you understood the instructions and know what to do on all subsequent issues upon assignment. (Note: Please provide estimates on all the issues that you pick up, going forward.)
    ```
   Availability for this week:

   - [ ] Time spent so far: Copy the question below into a new comment below (in this pre-work issue only) and answer it. This is just to get feedback on how long it took you to get to this point on this pre-work. There is no right or wrong answers. There is no judgement. It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.
    ```
    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?
    ```
   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**. The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.
    ```
    Provide Update
    1. Progress
    2. Blockers
    3. Availability
    4. ETA
    ```
- [ ] Read sections 3.1.a - 3.1.c in [3.1 How to make a pull request](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/2e3c45fede99e61f479548ccca3f0dda83e351db/CONTRIBUTING.md#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to learn more about how to make a pull request (PR) for the issue that you are working on and how to make changes to your PR if changes are requested by the reviewer
- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (two per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label ""Status: Help Wanted"" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the ""Development team meeting discussion items"" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.

- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (two per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label ""Status: Help Wanted"" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the ""Development team meeting discussion items"" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.

- [ ] Read sections 3.1.a - 3.1.c in [3.1 How to make a pull request](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/2e3c45fede99e61f479548ccca3f0dda83e351db/CONTRIBUTING.md#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to learn more about how to make a pull request (PR) for the issue that you are working on and how to make changes to your PR if changes are requested by the reviewer
- [ ] Additional notes:
   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.
   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.
- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.
Progress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue (two per person)
  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)
  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)
  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)
    - The reasons for this progression are:
      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.
    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:
      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity
      - Special request by a lead or pm
- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma
- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)
- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.

### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?
- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.
- Then, add the label ""Status: Help Wanted"" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.
- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.
- Lastly, you can add the issue to the ""Development team meeting discussion items"" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.
