# Hack for LA Onboarding Impact Analysis 

The Onboarding Impact Analysis is a data analytics project of Hack for LA to support decision-making to mazimize return-on-investment for onboarding efforts. Through this project, we analyze issues completed by onboarded developers (identified through closed prework issues) and identify patterns and insights in new developer behavior through various metrics and data visualizations in a Looker dashboard available on the Hack for LA website.

### Project context

By joining Hack for LA, new developers are provided basic training during onboarding and opportunities to improve their developer skills by working on volunteer projects made available by Hack for LA. A lot of time and effort is invested in onboarding new developers. Therefore, we want to ensure that we are allocating our time and resources properly to new developers invested in honing their skills and growing to seasoned developers. This project is a sub-component of [an issue](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/4152) that aims to automate the retrieval of GitHub issues by closed prework authors and maintain an updated data source for [Hack for LA's Looker dashboard](https://www.hackforla.org/dashboard/).
